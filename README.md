# Rafting Adventure Website

Welcome to the **Rafting Adventure** project, developed during the **Frontend Web Development (WDD 130)** course. This fictional rafting company website was created to apply key concepts of HTML, CSS, responsive design, and accessibility.

---

##  Course Concepts Applied

###  Semantic HTML
- Proper use of elements like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<figure>`, `<table>`, etc.
- Clear and hierarchical content structure.

###  CSS Styling
- Styling with class, ID, and element selectors.
- Use of CSS variables via `:root` for colors and fonts.
- Layouts built with `flexbox` and `grid`.
- Responsive design using `auto-fit`, `minmax`, and `media queries`.
- Custom styling for forms, buttons, tables, and navigation menus.

###  Best Practices
- Organized folder structure (`images/`, `styles/`, `index.html`, etc.).
- Consistent file naming without spaces or special characters.
- Functional internal links between pages (`Home`, `Trips`, `Contact`).
- `alt` attributes on images for accessibility.
- Custom fonts integrated via Google Fonts.

###  Accessibility & Usability
- Proper label associations using `for` and `id`.
- Enlarged clickable areas for buttons and links.
- High contrast color combinations for readability.
